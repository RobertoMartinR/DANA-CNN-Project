# DANA CNN Project
 
In this project the objective is to build a Deep Learning model using Convolutional Layers to early warn about possible problems like happened in Valencia's DANA in October 2024.
There are many ways to do something like this but in this case I'm focusing on images provided in real time by a webcam placed in any place of a river to use a Convolutional Neural Network.

The model is trained with images from a river in 3 states, when it's normal, when the water level is going up and when the water level is high, so doing that the model will be able to predict when the water flow is going up and send
a warning to the people living in that place so they will be able to leave before a disaster happens.
